Art Jam Response

The first art jam that caught my attention as my classmates were showing me their work was Arielle’s. The little example of real-life struggle that people with glasses go through daily was pretty awesome. 
I was going through the code and found out about the invisible circles she used as a trigger for the glasses to fog up, I thought it was super clever to introduce a “hitbox” mechanic in this simple assignment, I’m looking forward to replicating something similar in the near future. I was kind of scared to venture into playing with sound effects at first but after everyone’s code I can now see that it’s just a few lines of code that weren’t even complicated to begin with.

Even though some people’s art directions weren’t the best, I think user interaction can really bring any of your project to a new level. For instance, if we take Daniel’s project, he made a full-on playable game! As I peeked into his coding I start to see use of settings that aren’t obvious at first like the bool he used to smoothen the closing eye. Honestly I wanted to figure out how he managed to restrain the eyes without them literally following the cursor but instead by looking at the general direction of the cursor but it was kind of overwhelming.

I absolutely love the charm in Amelie’s art jam, it’s very reminiscent of early 2000’s computer graphics or the type of games you could download on your old computer like SkiFree.
As I’m going through all these project files, I slowly start to realize that I may have not been precise enough when specifying my functions in my own project.
Benjamin’s art jam made me see the potential in using const, I feel like it’s not so obvious to me when to use them properly but Benjamin did a great job at using const like a tool to parent other objects to it’s head while it’s being dragged up. Other than that his art jam definitely gave me a little surprise after seeing that I can take away his head, I kind of felt bad for a moment.
